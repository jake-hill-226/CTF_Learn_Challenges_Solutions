I think I lost my flag in there. Hopefully, it won't get attacked...

Step1: Download image from link

Step2: Open and notice there are formatting issues with the image

Step3: Open image in notepad and search for anomalies
	- Plain text file directories "Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This.../I Warned You.jpeg"

Step4: Find out that you can encode files into jpegs using winRar or a similar archiever

Step5: Open Image with winRar
	- Hidden file directories....fuck yeah!

Step6: Navigate to "Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This.../I Warned You.jpeg"
	   and open it
	- jpeg is corrupted and cannot be opened by image viewer

Step7: Open jpeg with note pad and use regex to find matches for "{.*}"
	   (the format of the CTF for this site)
	- Find the flag: ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}
